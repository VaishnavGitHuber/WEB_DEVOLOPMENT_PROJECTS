            <div class="col-md-8">
                <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR (15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian 
                    aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to
                     2007. Born and raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he studied physics 
                     and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science 
                     administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and 
                     Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian 
                     space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile 
                     Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.
                      He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II 
                      nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974</p>
                <h3>Early life and education</h3>
                <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the 
                    pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram 
                    on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father
                     Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat 
                    owner and imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.
                     His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now 
                     uninhabited Dhanushkodi.Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.
                    His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties
                     and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal 
                     Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. 
                     The family business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island 
                     and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban.
                      With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses 
                      failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the 
                      ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young 
                      boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's
                     meager income</p>
